# JS Workout

A collection of small projects I have made to help me improve my JavaScript skills. Some of them will be built with Vanilla JS and others (eventually) will be built in React.

Some of the projects were originally built a few years back as well but I'm refactoring them or planning to convert them into React apps. I'm also planning to build completely new stuff too.
